# 🎮 Rock Paper Scissors Game (Python - Jupyter Notebook)

This project is a simple **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game built using **Python** in a **Jupyter Notebook** environment (Anaconda).  
It allows the user to play against the computer, using Python’s `random` module to generate the computer’s moves.

## 🧠 How It Works
1. The user selects one of the three options: **Rock**, **Paper**, or **Scissors**.  
2. The computer randomly selects its choice using the `random` module.  
3. The program compares both choices and declares the winner.  
4. The player can continue playing until they decide to stop.
